Songs that could potentially work:

- Gumbel
  - Fortsetzung Folgt
  - Levels
- 505
  - Siebenschl√§fer
  - Messing
    - Has kind of a Bejeweled, demoscene sound to it. Probably not super fitting, too sad
  - Kitchentable
- RoccoW
  - Lady Bad Luck
    - While it doesn't fit for gameplay, it would actually be perfect for title screen music
- Goto80
  - ren onsdags-skit
    - Very weird, but funky
  - get down da fonk me
  - audiorosputnick
    - Has some weird bits at the end you should cut if you use this
  - aaf
    - Probably too fast, would make the game stressful
  - 3kr
    - Might hurt someone's ears
- Electric Children
  - Spring Retrospective
    - Isn't quite pure chiptune, might not sound right
