Let's get a to-do list going so we have a definite goal:

###For sure

- Game flow:
  - 20 levels
  - Last 5 levels don't show until you get bronze on the first 15
  - Levels 16-19 don't unlock until you get gold on the first 15
  - Level 20 doesn't unlock until you get diamond on every other level
- Cosmetic:
  - Sound effects
  - Some sort of first-run tutorial text explaining the controls
- Functional:
  - Options

###Optional

- Game flow:
  - Level 20 only has a diamond time
- Cosmetic:
  - Fish animation
  - Music stops/special fanfare when you get a diamond time
  - A "controller recommended" splash screen
  
###Optional (would make sense for a future update)

- Practice mode:
  - Allows you to choose from quarter, half, and three quarters speed
  - Doesn't affect your best times or unlocks
  - Can only be played on levels that are already unlocked
- Speedrun mode:
  - Every level in a row
  - Cumulative timer
  - Unlocks after unlocking level 20?
