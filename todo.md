Let's get a to-do list going so we have a definite goal:

###Optional

- Game flow:
  - Level 20 only has a diamond time
- Cosmetic:
  - Fish animation
  
###Optional (would make sense for a future update)

- Practice mode:
  - Allows you to choose from quarter, half, and three quarters speed
  - Doesn't affect your best times or unlocks
  - Can only be played on levels that are already unlocked
- Speedrun mode:
  - Every level in a row
  - Cumulative timer
  - Unlocks after unlocking level 20?
